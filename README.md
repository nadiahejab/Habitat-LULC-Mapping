# Habitat-LULC-Mapping

I am conducting a habitat mapping project focusing on teak, sal, and mixed dry deciduous forests in Orissa. The primary objective is to understand the distribution of these forest types and their impact on local wildlife. By analyzing the spatial distribution of these forest classes, we aim to assess how these habitats influence the life of various animal and plant species in the region.

### Key Components

Distribution Analysis: Mapping the spatial extent of teak, sal, and mixed dry deciduous forests to identify their distribution patterns across Orissa.

Habitat Impact Assessment : Evaluating how these forest types affect the wildlife and plant life within the region. This includes identifying potential species that thrive in these habitats and understanding their ecological needs.

Forest Cover Analysis : Determining the forest cover percentage for each forest type, which provides insights into the extent and health of these ecosystems.

Supervised Classification : Employing supervised classification techniques to accurately categorize the different forest types based on remote sensing data.

Data Utilization : Utilizing Sentinel data for detailed imagery and GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data for forest structure and height information, enhancing the accuracy and depth of habitat analysis.
